Project Group signup - Fri Week 2



Version Control

a repository tracks changes of a set of files over time (github)

Working Locally

- clone repo to local drive (only need to do for the first time)
- make changes
- once changes are complete used add to initiate staging process
- once staging is complete, uniformally update the history using commit (tracks who what and when something changed) STILL ONLY LOCAL
- "push" changes to update cloud files
